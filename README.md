It redirects users to the home page of the portfolio, which provides a little description about me and a picture. From there, the porfolio link in the navigation contains images of some of the projects I've created or participated in, as well as the links of the deployed applications and the GitHub repository. In the navigation section it can also be found a path to my resume, where a copy of it can we download, and to a contact me section, where a fom can be filled in to make life easier.
